/*
Option #1: Calculate Average Withholding

Create a program that will calculate the weekly average tax withholding for a customer given the following
weekly income guidelines:

    Income less than $500: tax rate 10%
    Incomes greater than/equal to $500 and less than $1500: tax rate 15%
    Incomes greater than/equal to $1500 and less than $2500: tax rate 20%
    Incomes greater than/equal to $2500: tax rate 30%

Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the application,
the results and GIT repository in a single document.

Pseudocode:

BEGIN

    // Create a scanner object to capture user input
    CREATE userInput AS Scanner

    // Prompt the user for their income
    PRINT "Enter your income (whole number): "
    PRINT "> "

    // Store user input in the variable 'income'
    SET income TO userInput.nextInt()

    // Define constants for tax rates
    SET lowTaxRate TO 0.1
    SET midTaxRate TO 0.15
    SET highTaxRate TO 0.2
    SET veryHighTaxRate TO 0.3

    // Define constants for income thresholds
    SET lowThreshold TO 500
    SET midThreshold TO 1500
    SET highThreshold TO 2500

    // Declare variables to store the tax withholding and the used tax rate
    SET taxWithholding TO 0
    SET usedTaxRate TO 0

    // Determine tax withholding based on income
    IF income < lowThreshold THEN
        SET taxWithholding TO income * lowTaxRate
        SET usedTaxRate TO lowTaxRate
    ELSE IF income < midThreshold THEN
        SET taxWithholding TO income * midTaxRate
        SET usedTaxRate TO midTaxRate
    ELSE IF income < highThreshold THEN
        SET taxWithholding TO income * highTaxRate
        SET usedTaxRate TO highTaxRate
    ELSE IF income >= highThreshold THEN
        SET taxWithholding TO income * veryHighTaxRate
        SET usedTaxRate TO veryHighTaxRate
    ELSE
        // Handle unexpected inputs
        SET taxWithholding TO 0
        SET usedTaxRate TO 0
    END IF

    // Display the results
    PRINT "Your weekly tax withholding is: "
    PRINT "$" + taxWithholding
    PRINT "Based on an income of: $" + income
    PRINT "And a tax rate of: " + (usedTaxRate * 100) + "%"
